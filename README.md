# OIBSIP_TASK2
This project implements a machine learning model to classify emails as spam or ham (non-spam). 
The goal is to use various Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to preprocess email text data and then apply machine learning algorithms to build an accurate spam detection model.
The project explores a variety of supervised learning algorithms to find the best-performing model, including Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Random Forests. The dataset used is composed of labeled email messages with the corresponding spam or ham labels.
